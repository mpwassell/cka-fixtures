two Cambs clubs face off against each other.  A close first half saw little in it, with both teams leading at stages, but rarely more than a goal in it and Tigers eventually going in 7-6 up. In the 2nd half Vikings managed to pull 12-10 up, only for Tigers to equalise in the last few minutes. In the end a draw was prob a result Although there was stuff to encourage coaches from both clubs, Tigers will be upset with themselves for missing a a handful of penalties, and Vikings gave the ball away far too often.
