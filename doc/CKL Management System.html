<h1>Actors</h1>

<p>The following 'actors' will be interacting with the CKLMS in someway. We
describe below what these actors do without being too specific about what any
system does do, does not do or will do. We limit ourselves to using abstract

<p></p>

<h1>The System</h1>

<p>Back of the mind question: What should the relationship between CKLMS and
Fixtures Live be?</p>

<p>Authentication and Roles/Groups</p>

<p>Access to parts of the system will be controlled by membership of a group.
These groups will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Admin [ Django admin user]</li>
  <li>League Admin - Manage fixtures and approve score cards</li>
  <li>Club Admin - Manage player names (Need to make sure a club admin can only
    admin details for their club)</li>
  <li>Referee - Ability to enter score cards</li>
  <li>Public - View fixtures, league tables and statistics.</li>
</ul>

<p>All except 'Public' role will require the user to authenticate ie public
role. </p>

<p>Django: Use the 'permissions_required' decorator:</p>

<p>Leage admin -
@permission_required('ckl.can_approve_scorecard|can_edit_scorecard|can_edit_player')</p>

<p>Club Admin -
@permission_required('ckl.can_view_own_players|can_edit_own_players')</p>

<p>Referee - @permission_required('ckl.can_edit_own_scorecard')</p>

<p>And no decorator for public pages.</p>

<p>Will need to add club name for people added to Django user table OR make it
a relationship to their entry in the 'players' table.</p>

<h2>Fixtures Display</h2>

<p>View table of fixtures for current season</p>

<p>View scores for fixtures that have been player; link provided to view
scorecard</p>

<p>Be able to filter by: Division, Club, Team, Period, Played and not played
yet</p>

<p>View fixtures that have changes pending</p>

<h2>Fixture Changes</h2>

<p>Allow suitably authorised people to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a change that will be marked as pending. The fixtures list will
    include an indication that a change is pending.</li>
  <li>Approve a pending change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Player Administration</h2>

<p>The system should provide the means to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add new players to the database. With facility for clubs to easily check
    players registered in the database and to make or request changes.</li>
  <li>Mark players as inactive (so that they for example don't appear in the
    player lists on the scorecard entry form).</li>
  <li>Handle name changes.</li>
  <li>Handle the case where there two entries in the database for the same
    player - player merging. (This is not required if there is water-tight
    control over entry of players).</li>
  <li>Handle U18 players as per the league rules that apply.</li>
</ol>

<p>Authorisation for the above should be such that a club admin can only edit
</p>

<h2>Scorecard Entry</h2>

<p>Either from the fixtures paage (via a link only visible to referees) or via
a page showing only that referees commitments, allow access to a scorecard</p>

<p>It coming to scorecard form a link on fixtures page or commitment list,
prefill with fixture information.</p>

<p>Provide option to prefill player names with names from last match for each
team. </p>

<p>Do some/all of the checks listed below</p>

<h2>Scorecard Processing and Display</h2>

<p>Processing of the scorecard needs to handle the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Line up is not 8 players either at start, during match or the end.</li>
  <li>Starting line up is not 8 players and a sub comes on to fill empty
  slot.</li>
  <li>Player comes off but is not replaced.</li>
  <li>Record player's time on court to enable status calculation to be carried
    out.</li>
  <li>Player name is not in player table. System should allow referee to enter
    scorecard but scorecard should not be approved until the name appears in
    the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needs to check the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status of players conforms to league rules.</li>
  <li>Names not in database are flagged.</li>
  <li>Goal arrangment matches accepted pattern.</li>
  <li>Ref rating of team behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Processing should be a two step process - referee submits scorecard and then
results officer approves it. For the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gives the results officer the chance to catch any errors.</li>
  <li>Prevents accidental or malicious manipulation of results.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a scorecard is approved the following needs to happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Match details moved from staging to main tables. The played fixture will
    show up on the fixtures table and the scorecard will be accessible.</li>
  <li>League tables are updated.</li>
  <li>Player goal and match appearance statistics are updated.</li>
  <li>Player status points are updated. Pending status page reflects this
    update.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scorecards should *not* display the U18 tag for any player.</p>

<h2>Player Status</h2>

<p>For a walkover ruling occuring after the match has been played, the match
does not count toward status count [CHECK]</p>

<h3>League Tables</h3>

<p>Matches against development teams do not count for any metric in the league
table.</p>

<h2>Player Statistics</h2>

<p>Player statistics (matches played and goals scored) will be shown on a
simple goals scored table and a more complex 'pie' table.</p>

<p>Walkover games do not count towards either goals score nor the count of
matches played. However development team matches do (?)</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Audit Trail</h2>

<p>Make it easy to view history of pages. With a batch based approach of
loading scorecards and then dumping and upload to server, it was easy to do
this.</p>

<p>What about a weekly snap shot with </p>

<h2>Feed to fixtures live</h2>

<p>Entering of goals score can be done using results officer login</p>

<p>Match details can only be entered by appropriate team in match. For an
automatic system to be used, this system will need the club's fixtures live
login.</p>

<p>Selenium is one option for automating the entry but is slow and a little
buggy. PhantonJS is another and allows the server to do the task without having
to popup a browser window.</p>

<h2>Pages</h2>

<p>All/most pages directly accesssible. If login is required, will go to login
page and if logged in successfuly redirect back to first page</p>

<p>Also provide an index page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous user - show publicable accessible pages. Include a 'login'
  link</li>
  <li>For a logged in user, depending on their role, show additional links to
    other pages</li>
</ul>

<p>Public links - All these are HTML</p>
<ul>
  <li>cka/fixtures - Main fixtures page</li>
  <li>cka/division/table?division=&lt;division_num&gt; - Division table divison
    OR cka/division/&lt;division_num&gt;/table</li>
  <li>cka/division/goals?division=&lt;division_num&gt; - Goal scorers by
    divison OR ...</li>
  <li>cka/player/goals</li>
  <li>cka/player/status</li>
</ul>

<p>Referee</p>
<ul>
  <li>cka/scorecard/entry?fixture=&lt;fixture id&gt; OR
    cka/scorecard/&lt;fixture_id&gt;/entry [GET] - HTML</li>

</ul>

<p>Club Admin</p>
