<center><h2>CKA League Fixtures Change and Postpone Requests</h2></center>
Use this page if you are the home club for a fixture and you want to do one of the following:
<ul>
    <li>You want to indicate that the fixture needs to be changed. Click 'Pending' against the fixture in the list below.
    <li>You want to indicate that the change to the fixture has been agreed. Click 'Agreed' against the fixture in the list below.
</ul>

Note that:
<ul>
<li>Under CKL <a href="http://www.cambskorfball.co.uk/cka_league_rules.htm">rules</a>, fixture changes are only permitted under exceptional circumstances and so you will need to provide a strong reason for the change.
<li>CKL rules explicitly rule out 'inability to field a full strength team'.
<li>Fixtures Officer approval is always required, even if both teams agree.
<li>Refereeing clubs don't need to agree to a fixture change as refereeing
commitments can be swapped.
</ul>

Once you have filled in the form and clicked submit, the following will be sent emails:
<ul>
    <li>Results and Fixtures Officers.
    <li>Representative of home and away clubs.
    <li>Representative of refereeing club.
</ul>

<!--
1. Notification from a club that a fixture needs to be changed. This can
then be highlighted in the fixtures list so players and referees don't
turn up for matches which aren't happening.
2. Notification from the home club that a fixture change has been agreed.
